This repository demonstrates a common React Native error: accessing a state variable or prop before initialization, typically during asynchronous operations.  The `bug.js` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.js` shows the corrected version.  The error occurs when attempting to render UI elements that depend on data fetched asynchronously before the fetch completes, resulting in a runtime error. The solution involves proper conditional rendering to handle cases where the data is still loading or null.  This is a critical aspect of building robust and error-free React Native applications.
