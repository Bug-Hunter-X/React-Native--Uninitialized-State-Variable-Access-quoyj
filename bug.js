This error occurs when you try to access a state variable or prop before it has been properly initialized.  This commonly happens in asynchronous operations where data might not be available immediately. For example, within a `useEffect` hook that fetches data, trying to render UI elements based on the fetched data before the `fetch` call is complete will cause this error.

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch('some-api-endpoint')
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => setData(data));
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      {/* Error:  data might be null here! */}
      <p>Data: {data.someProperty}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
export default MyComponent;
```
